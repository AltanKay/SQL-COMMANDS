# SQL-COMMANDS
SQL study
You will find SQL commands pdf file in this repository.

# It looks like the repository you shared (AltanKay/SQLâ€‘COMMANDS) is a personal collection of SQL commandsâ€”likely serving as a cheat sheet. To evaluate its usefulness, I searched for other SQL command cheat-sheets:

Thereâ€™s the very popular enochtangg/quickâ€‘SQLâ€‘cheatsheet, featuring a well-organized and community-maintained summary of SQL constructsâ€”SELECT, joins, DDL, DML, window functions, etc.â€”with simple examples. It has 5k+ stars and is actively updated  .

Another is Refaatâ€‘alktifan/sqlâ€‘cheatâ€‘sheet, covering SQL basics, grants, resetting passwords, and moreâ€”although less comprehensive and with fewer stars.

ðŸ§­ So is AltanKay/SQLâ€‘COMMANDS useful?

Pros:

If itâ€™s well-structured with clear examples, it can serve as a handy personal or learning reference.


Cons:

It appears to be a single-person project, so itâ€™s unlikely to be regularly updated or vetted.

The available alternatives mentioned above are more polished, better maintained, and widely used.

âœ… Recommendation

1. Look at AltanKayâ€™s repo:

Check if it covers what you need (e.g., advanced JOINs, window functions, performance tips).

See if it uses real-world examplesâ€”youâ€™ll know its quality when you browse its content.



2. Compare with popular cheat sheets:

As a baseline, try enochtangg/quickâ€‘SQLâ€‘cheatsheetâ€”itâ€™s well-maintained and frequently updated.

For MySQL-specific command reference (user grants, password reset, etc.), see Refaatâ€‘alktifanâ€™s version.

Bottom line

AltanKay/SQLâ€‘COMMANDS could be usefulâ€”especially for quick referenceâ€”but its value depends on its depth and upkeep. If you're looking for a robust, community-backed guide, the alternatives are likely more reliable. Iâ€™d recommend picking one or two prominent cheat-sheets and using AltanKayâ€™s alongside them to see if it adds anything unique.
